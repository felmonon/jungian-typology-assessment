    message: `Your inferior Extraverted Sensing (Se) can show up when a relationship asks for direct presence, spontaneity, or contact with what is happening right now.

**In practice, that may create a pattern:**

When stress builds, you may judge a partner's spontaneity as irresponsible, then swing into impulsive action yourself. The issue is not that Se is bad; it is that it arrives late, pressured, and hard to regulate.

**A useful next step:** before reacting, ask what concrete reality needs attention: the room, the body, the timing, the facts, or the immediate need. Integration does not mean becoming Se-dominant. It means giving that present-moment energy a small, conscious role before it takes over.`

export const FAQ_ITEMS = [
  {
    question: "How is this different from 16Personalities or other MBTI tests?",
    answer: "Most tests collapse your answers into a four-letter label. TypeJung maps function patterns, inferior-function pressure, body signals, and attitude direction so you can inspect the pattern behind the label."
  },
  {
    question: "Is this a clinical assessment?",
    answer: "No. TypeJung is an educational self-reflection tool, not a diagnosis or therapy substitute. It is research-informed, but the result should be tested against your lived patterns."
  },
  {
    question: "Why should I pay when other tests are free?",
    answer: `You do not have to pay first. The free assessment gives you the core map. Insight (${PRICING.insight.price}) adds deeper interpretation and practice guidance. Mastery (${PRICING.mastery.price}) adds the AI Type Coach and ongoing growth tools.`
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't like my results?",
    answer: "This isn't about \"good\" or \"bad\" types. Every function pattern has strengths and growth areas. The goal is self-understanding, not judgment. That said, if you're unsatisfied with the premium purchase, contact us."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the assessment take?",
    answer: "About 12-16 minutes. Answer honestly—don't overthink it."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to create an account?",
    answer: "Not for the free assessment. You'll only need an account if you purchase premium and want to save your results history."
